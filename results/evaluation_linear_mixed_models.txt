Linear mixed model analysis:
When predicting GPPsat, the fixed effects were -0.06 for wLL, -13.44 for wLMA, and 6.07* for wNmass (asterisks denote significant effects based on anova results).
The within group (IGBP) standard deviation of LAImax was 1.38.
When predicting RECOmax, the fixed effects were 0.00 for wLL, -11.51* for wLMA, and 1.34* for wNmass (asterisks denote significant effects based on anova results).
The within group (IGBP) standard deviation of LAImax was 0.14.
